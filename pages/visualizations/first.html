                    <p>Most of my experience was in making dashboards. I could build a metamodel, do some 
                        simple data cleaning, and use a BI tool to make the visual or dashboard that I desired. 
                        While I enjoyed this, through my time on the SEMOSS team I got to learn more about 
                        what development looks like and the power that comes with it. From there I started to try 
                        and understand more of the SEMOSS Front End Architecture by pestering some developers with questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>I came to understand that there were two types of open-sourced visualizations that SEMOSS primarily 
                        used; d3 and echarts. So I knew where to look, but what could I visualize? Coming up with these 
                        questions has never been a strong suit of mine, but I figured out the perfect place to look. This 
                        brings me to Reddit.
                    </p>
                    <p>A Reddit through called Data Is Beautiful <a href="https://reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/" target="_blank">(check it out) </a>
                        was brought to my attention and I was a big fan of seeing all of the cool and flashy ways people 
                        visualized the most random data. From there we saw that there was a monthly Data Viz contest, and I 
                        finally had something fun to visualize. Brainstorming with a friend, we jokingly said on Sunday night 
                        we would grab dinner and work on winning this competition. We coined it 'Dinner Data Viz'. 
                        As you can imagine, I went too far with it and put up an entire page around it! I'm not kidding, 
                        <a href="http://dinnerdataviz.github.io" target="_blank">Dinner Data Viz</a> is a real thing I created. 
                        Below is the scatter plot, from the contest in 
                        <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/cmrz6j/battle_dataviz_battle_for_the_month_of_august/" target="_blank">August.</a>
                    </p>
                    <div id="scatter">
                        <script type="text/javascript" src="/assets/js/visualizations/scatter.creatures.js"></script>
                    </div>
                    <p>This ended up being a project I truly enjoyed, and I felt that I was challenged all the way 
                        through. While it's a very simple scatter plot (I never even submitted it to the competition), 
                        I got to learn how to use the d3 API which I was very excited about. What's next? Allow users to 
                        interact with it! Have a color picker, design the tooltip, all within the page. Check back and it 
                        might look different.
