                    <p>Linganore High School in Frederick, Maryland. Typically High School is a time where people
                        start to figure out what they want to be doing, and it was no different for me.</p>
                    <p>I would consider myself a relatively involved student, and enjoyed being busy - a trait
                        that I have not learned to shake off just yet. During my time there, I did one horrific season
                        of Indoor Track (learned the hard way that you actually still practice outside everyday) and 4
                        seasons of lacrosse. Outside of sports, was in a lot of the boring honor society's but had a
                        great
                        time in French Honor Society. Why did I take French instead of Spanish even though Spanish would
                        have been much more helpful? After signing up for Spanish in 7th grade, I wasn't able to take it
                        because of the math class I was enrolled in and also in band. Which leaves me here barely
                        remembering French while everyone around me speaks Spanish.
                    </p>
                    <p>I think that about sums things up from my time, but as always happy to share more. Please leave a
                        message below!</p>
